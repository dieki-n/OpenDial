# OpenDial

This project is ESP32 firmware for a clone of a Microsoft Surface Dial-like device. 

It implements the surface dial protocol over BLE HID and appears as a Surface Dial to Windows. This means it works with all the apps that implement support for the surface dial, like Photoshop or Sketchable.
